    "<h3>Steve Jobs once said \"Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.\" Language has been our primary means of communication with each other for thousands of years, but things have changed since the past 20 years. We are now able to communicate with technology since it is a ubiquitous medium. Our world is filled with computers and what they all have in common is the numerical language they use to communicate and all their functionalities and features are based on programming. When you look at the modern code you use to program your computer, you’ll find it’s not much different than what you write as texts or emails. There are many pieces of hardware and software that need to communicate with each other which is why programming languages became the way of interacting with our computers. Computing makes communication easier for many reasons, including but not limited to:</h3>\n",

    "<b>Python is a very simple programming language, developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute in Netherlands and it was released in the year 1991. Python is designed to be highly readable,it uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</b>\n",

    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Python Features</h3>\n",
    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>Easy-to-learn:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>python has simple structure, and a simple syntax This allows the student to pick up the language quickly and it can be easily coded and read.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>Easy-to-read:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>Portable:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all of them.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>Extendable:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>GUI Programming:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Python supports GUI applications (Graphical user interfaces) that can be developed using Python.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>Large standard library:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Python comes with a large standard library that has lot of handy codes and functions which we can use while writing code in Python.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Python characteristics</h3>\n",
    "------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>High-level language:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>It is a high-level language used for scripting. It means one does not need to remember the system architecture and no need for managing the memory as well.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>Open source:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Python is open source and readily available over the internet anywhere. One does not need to take the license of it. It can be easily downloaded and use.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>Databases:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>Interpreted:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>The python code does not need to compile as required for other languages. Python code automatically converts the source code into byte code internally and the code is executed line by line not at once, so it takes more time to execute the code for the application.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>Platform independent:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Python is platform independent. The python code can be used for any operating system like Windows, Unix, Linux, and Mac. There is no need to write different code for the different OS.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>Interactive Mode:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>A broad standard library:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h3>Scalable:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</h5>\n",

    "We refer to Lists in side a python program with (dict)</h5>\n",
