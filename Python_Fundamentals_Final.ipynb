        "Steve Jobs once said \"Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.\" Language has been our primary mean of communication for thousands of years. Just like how humans speak languages to communicate, programming allows people to instruct computers to perform certain tasks, or in other words, communicate with the computer. Have you ever wanted to create your own games, make an e-commerce website, analyze the latest trend in stocks, or even make a robot? Programming is a versatile tool with limitless possibilities. Programming was used to do everything from code the Amazon Alexa to create Sophia, a humanlike AI robot which can react and speak with humans. Programming is integrated into everything around us, and learning programming languages is an exciting skill and very applicable in the 21st century.\n",

Python is designed to be highly readable, meaning that it uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and can also program with simpler, shorter code. Python is a very good beginner programming language and can also be used for more advanced functions like creating analytical charts and arrays that are useful in data science.\n",

In order for the computer to compute a simple mathematical equation like 2+2, the 2 and the 2 are specific locations in memory and it must go through a microprocessor to translate those numbers into 0's and 1's. In Python, instead of going through a microprocessor directly, the program must go through an interpreter tool first. The python language cannot operate on its own, as its interpreter tool is managed by the C language. This is why Python is slower to compile than other languages like Java and C because it has that extra step to go through. In computer terminology, Python has the highest level of abstraction, meaning that the code we write is the easiest, and is much different from what the computer compiler needs to see before processing the code, leading to the need of an interpreter tool. However, the C language has the lowest level of abstraction, meaning it is harder to code because it is more similar to the computer's compiler code, but it also processes much faster than Python and is a more independent program.</h5>\n",
