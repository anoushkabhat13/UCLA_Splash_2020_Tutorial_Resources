        "Steve Jobs once said \"Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.\" Language has been our primary mean of communication for thousands of years. Just like how humans speak languages to communicate, programming allows people to instruct computers to perform certain tasks, or in other words, communicate with the computer. Have you ever wanted to create your own games, make an e-commerce website, analyze the latest trend in stocks, or even make a robot? Programming is a versatile tool with limitless possibilities. Programming was used to do everything from code the Amazon Alexa to create Sophia, a humanlike AI robot which can react and speak with humans. Programming is integrated into everything around us, and learning programming languages is an exciting skill and very applicable in the 21st century.\n",

Python, Java, C++, and Perl are all examples of programming languages. They all have code which tell the computer what to do, but their <b>syntax</b> is a little bit different. Think of programming languages like different dialects of a language. Each dialect is a little bit different, but the same message will get across.\n",

Python is designed to be highly readable, meaning that it uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and can also program with simpler, shorter code. Python is a very good beginner programming language and can also be used for more advanced functions like creating analytical charts and arrays that are useful in data science.\n",
